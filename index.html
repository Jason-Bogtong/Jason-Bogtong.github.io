        <p>
          Dining places on campus sometimes lose students' order slips, depriving them of a meal and a meal swipe which are limited.

                For my persona, I decided to view the app in the eyes of a student. As the persona states,"They are tired of losing their meal swipes because of carelessness." They are a normal college student who pays a lot to use the meal swipe plan.
