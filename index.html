        <h2> Problen Statement: Meal Swipes</h2>
        <p>
          Dining places on campus sometimes lose students' order slips, depriving them of a meal and a meal swipe which are limited.

              Our group spent time brainstorming the app, its features, how we would advertise it, and the effects it has on other people.

                For my persona, I decided to view the app in the eyes of a student. As the persona states,"They are tired of losing their meal swipes because of carelessness." They are a normal college student who pays a lot to use the meal swipe plan.

              <p>
                My storyboard is about a student wanting to order food after a day of work. He uses the app to order food and waits to be notified that their food is ready. Once ready, he goes and picks it up.
